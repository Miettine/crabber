# Crabber

Crabber is a game themed around crab fishing. The gameplay is similar to Minesweeper. Made using the Unity engine, the game utilizes Unity's Tile System.

The game is nearly complete as of writing this. Current plan is to launch it to the web as a free game, playable in the browser (also with a mobile phone). The graphics still use place holders, with flag sprites signifying pots' buoys and the number 18 represented by the letter J (this was done because of practical reasons that are hard to explain).
